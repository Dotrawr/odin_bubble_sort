# The Odin Project
## Bubble Sort

This repo contains my implementation of the Bubble Sort project as described in The Odin Project.

The documentation says to: 

  ```Build a method #bubble_sort that takes an array and returns a sorted array. It must use the bubble sort methodology (using #sort would be pretty pointless, wouldnâ€™t it?).```
  
and gives this example:
```ruby
> bubble_sort([4,3,78,2,0,2])
=> [0,2,2,3,4,78]
```
